INTRODUCTION
===================
A reenactment of Physical Review E 74, 061908 (2006), Szabo et. al.


REQUIREMENTS
===================
. A compiler with the C++11 standard
. MersenneTwister.h (mine is in /usr/local/include) from Makoto Matsumoto, historically hosted at http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/emt.html
. CxxTest library (mine is v4.0.3, from Ubuntu apt-get on 06/28/13)

FOR QT:
. Qt 5.1.0, with libraries in good places (added to /etc/ld.so.conf)
	. icu suite (added to /etc/ld.so.conf), including [icui18n, icuuc, icudata]

The Makefile assumes that -I & -L is not needed for the above libraries. Modify CPPFLAGS if you have local installations that are not in the compiler path.
	(QT and icu paths are brutally added to the makefile, so it might be worth doing something better than this in the future.)

INSTRUCTIONS
===================
To use make to build the code and the testing suite, call: 
>> make 

To build with double precision, call:
>> make "CXXFLAGS=-D DP"
